Information about 3D printable Frame1-style circular keycaps
------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview:
  There are extremely limited commercially-available options for circular keycaps that fit standard mechanical switches.
A viable alternative is 3D printing the keycaps through an online service.  Although there are numerous online 3D printing services, most of them are prohibitively expensive.  The cheapest one (as far as I know) is JLCPCB, a PCB manufacturer based in China that also offers 3D printing in several materials.

### Guide to ordering keycaps from JLC:

 - Go to jlcpcb.com

 - Click "Instant Quote"
 - Click the "3D Printing" tab
 - Upload 3D files (download from .stl_files folder)
    - Be sure to use the model with the filename corresponding to the chosen material
 - Select material/color/quantity

### Alternatives to JLC:

  If you live in the EU it may be cheaper overall to order nylon keycaps from Xometry (xometry.com).  The part cost is higher than JLC but the shipping fees are lower.
  To order from Xometry:
  - Upload nylon .stl file
  - Select HP Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) as the process
  - Select Nylon 12 as the material
  - You will have the option to select natural gray or dyed black for the color
  - A minimum order cost will apply, so you will get better value by ordering multiple sets

### Notes on materials:

There are two materials on JLC that have been tested and work well:
 - LEDO6060 resin:
    -  Extremely cheap (~$3.30 USD for 20 keycaps)
    -  Fairly durable
    -  Available in white only
    -  Smooth, matte finish
 - PA12-HP Nylon
    - More expensive (~$12.50 USD for 20 keycaps)
    - Very durable
    - Available in natural grey or dyed black
    - Textured finish
 
 ### Notes on quantities:
 
 Each file contains 10 keycaps joined by thin "sprues".  This is to get around the minimum part cost.  The keycaps can be separated with flush cutters or a sharp knife
 A standard rectangle controller in the style of B0XX or Frame1 uses 20 buttons.
 It is advisable to order an additional set (30 total keycaps) to have extras in case of quality control issues. This is rare, but with shipping time and cost, having extras just in case can be nice
 
 ### Notes on the 3D models:
 
 The two files in the .stl_files folder are similar but optimized for the material in the filename.
 
 The design of the keycap is heavily inspired by Haystack's "NoCap" project (https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/NoCap/)
 
 Diameter of the keycaps is 20.64mm (same as Frame1 keycaps).  For a good fit, use a top panel with 22mm holes.
 
 Height of the keycap is 8mm (slightly lower-profile than Frame1 keycaps)
 
### Buying from me:
 
 If you are located in the USA and would not like to wait 2 weeks for shipping from China, I have a small stock of these keycaps that I am reselling.
 
 __This will be (a little) more expensive than ordering directly from JLC__
 
 Prices range from $12 to $35 for a set of 22 caps, I have white and black as well as the ability to dye in custom colors.
