Information about 3D printable Frame1-style circular keycaps
------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview:
  There are extremely limited commercially-available options for circular keycaps that fit standard mechanical switches.
A viable alternative is 3D printing the keycaps through an online service.  Although there are numerous online 3D printing services, most of them are prohibitively expensive.  The cheapest one (as far as I know) is JLCPCB, a PCB manufacturer based in China that also offers 3D printing in several materials.
